 Directories and File Enumeration 

	- users of search engines can not find resources that are not linked by a web page on the internet 
	- even unlinked files and directories can be accessed by anyone knowing the URL 

	- enumeration
		-  helps find those "hidden" resources that contain: 
			- New and untested features
			- backup files
			- testing information
			- developer's notes 

		- two ways to enumerate resources; 
			- pure brute-force
			- dictionary attacks 

		- brute force enumeration 
			- try every possible combination 
			- inefficient 
			- ex. need 287979 trials to find the string "home"

		- dictionary based enumeration
			- understand what common names people tend to give files and directories 
			-list of common file names, directory names and file extensions
				- ex. common backup file names: 
					- .bak, .old, .txt & .xxx

	- Dirbuster Video 

		- use GET or Automatically switch between HEAD and GET 
		- select "Go Faster"
		- list based dirbuster will try different names 
		- direcotry to start with / 
		- file extension = back,old
		- recursive = scan directory over and over 

	- Dirb Video 

		- brute for app resources 
		- pre installed 
		- word list of potential resources 

		- look for github word lists github 
		- -u basic authentication
		- -p proxy 
		- -z delay setting in miliseconds 
		- -x specify extensions 
		- -o save the results to a file
