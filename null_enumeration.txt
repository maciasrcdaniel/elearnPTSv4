ENUMERATING WINDOWS SHARES 

	- nbtstat command 
	
		- Most common command to use when enumerating Windows Shares 

		- Can display information about a target 

		- nbstat /? = check how to use

		- Most common use of nbstat is: 

			- nbstat -A <IP> 

				- Displays the following information
					- Local Area Connection: 
					- Node Padres:[10.0.2.15] Scope Id: []

					- NetBIOS Remote Machine Name Table 

					- Name	Type Status 

					- ELS- WINXIP <00> Unique Registered 

				- Name = the machine running at <ip> 

				- Record Type = <00> tells use that it is a workstation

				- "UNIQUE" = tells use that this computer must have only 1 IPaddress assigned 

				- Line under contains the "WORKGROUP" text that tells us the domain the computer is joined to 

				- <20> = tells us that the file sharing service is up and running on the machine 







	- NET VIEW command

		- Once attacker knows that a machine has a FILE SERVER service running they can enumerate the shares 

		- SYNTAX: 
			> NET VIEW <target IP> 

		- Can see what shares are being shared 



	- Nmblookup command 

		- Shares enumeration from a linux machine
		
		- Will require the Samba Suite 

		- Already installed on Kali linux 

		- SYNTAX 

			- # nmblookup -A <target IP address> 


	- Smbclient command 

		- FTP-like client to access Windows Shares 

		- SYNTAX 

			- $ smbclient -L //10.130.40.80 -N 

		- -L = allows you to look at what services are available on a target 

		- With //<IP Address> you have to prepend two slashes to the target IP address 

		- -N = forces teh tool to not ask for a password 

		- Also displays administrative shares that are hidden when using Windows standard tools 



CHECKING FOR NULL SESSIONS 


	-  Time to check if a null session attack is possible 

	- To verify we will exploit the "IPC$" administrative share by trying to connect to it without valid credentials 




CHECKING FOR NULL SESSIONS WITH WINDOWS 

	- To connect: 

		> NET USE \\<target IP address>\IPC$ '' /u:''

		- Tells Windows to connect to the IPC$ share by using an empty password and an empty username! 

	- Ex. > net use \\10.130.40.80\IPC$ '' /u:''

		- Access Granted 

	- ONLY WORKS WITH \IPC$





CHECKING FOR NULL SESSIONS WITH LINUX 


	- Syntax 

		# smbclient //10.130.40.80/IPC$ -N 

		# smbclient //10.130.40.80/C$ -N 

	


EXPLOITING NULL SESSIONS 


	- Can be done by using the Windows NET command, tools to automate 


	- Enum command

		- retrieve information from a system vulnerable to null session attacks 

		- Install by just extracting it and running it from the Windows command prompt 

		- SYNTAX 

			> enum -S 10.130.40.80

			- -S = lets you enumerate the shares of a machine 

			- enumerates administrative shares as well 

			- -U = enumerates users 
		
			- > enum -U 10.130.40.80

			- -P = can check the password policy 

		- Checking password policies before running an authentication attack lets you find-tune an attack tool: 

			- prevent accounts locking 
			- prevent false positives 
			- choose your dictionary or your bruteforcer configuration 




EXPLOITING NULLS SESSIONS WITH WINFO 



		- Automate null session exploitation

		SYNTAX 

			> winfo 10.130.40.80 -n 

		- -n = tell the tool to use null sessions 



EXPLOITING NULL SESSIONS WITH enum4linux 


	- A PERL script that can perform the same operations of enum and Winfo

	- By default it performs: 

		- User enumeration / share enumeration / group and member enumeration / password policy extraction / os information detection / a nmblookup run / printer information extraction
