Window Shares 

NETBIOS

	- Network Basic Input Output System

	- Servers and clients use NetBIOS when viewing network shares on the local area network 

	- NetBIOS can supply some of the following information when querying a computer 
		- Hostname
		- NetBIOS Name 
		- Domain
		- Network Shares 

	- NetBIOS API sits betwenn the application layer and the IP layer

	- UDP is used to perform NetBIOS "name resolution" and to carry other "one-to-many" datagram-based communications 

	-Heavy traffic, such as file copy, relies on TCP by using NetBIOS "sessions" 

	- Different features use different ports and transport protocols 

	- When MS Windows machine browses a network it uses NetBIOS: 
		- DATAGRAMS = to list the shares and the machines 
		- NAMES = to find the workgroups 
		- SESSIONS = to transmit data to and from a "Windows Share" 

SHARES 

	- Windows machine can share a file or a directory on the network; lets local and remote users access teh resouce and, possibly modify it 

		- Ex. File server in an office let users opne and edit documents of their own department, while it lets everyone read but not modify public information files 

	- Turn on File and Printer Sharing service and then they can start choosing directories or files to share 

	- Users can also set permissions on a share (reading/writing/modifying) 

	- Can share a file or a public directory 

UNC PATHS 

	- Authorized user can access shares by using "Universal Naming Convention Paths (UNC PATHS)" 

	- SYNTAX 
		\\ServerName\ShareName\file.nat


ADMINISTRATIVE SHARES 

	- Administrative shares 

		- \\ComputerName\C$ = lets an administrator access a volume on the local machine. Every volume has a share (C$, D$, E$, etc.) 

		- \\ComputerName\admin$ = points to the windows installation directory 

		- \\ComputerName\ipc$ = is used for inter-process communication. You cannot browse it via Windows Explorer 

	- Example: \\localhost\<sharename> 


BADLY CONFIGURED SHARES 

	- Accesing a share means having access to the resources of the computer hosting it. Can be exploiting by: 

		- Information Disclosure 
		- Unauthorized File Access 
		- Information Leakage used to mount a targeted attack


NULL SESSIONS 

	- Null session attacks = can be used to enumerate alof of information about: 
		- Passwords
		- System Usersf
		- System Groups 
		- Running System Processes 

	- Null sessions are remotely exploitable 
		- Attack can be used to call remote API's and remote procedure calls 
		- Legacy hosts are still vulnerable 

	- NS attack exploits an authentication vulnerability for Windows Administrative Shares -> attacker connects to local or remote share without authentication
