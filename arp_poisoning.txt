ARP Poisoning 


	ARP Poisoning = powerful attack you can use to INTERCEPT traffic on a switched network 


	- Sending a packet a host needs to know a mac address of the next hop 

	- If attacker manipulates the ARP tables of two parties involved in a communication and will be able to sniff the whole communication -> MAN IN THE MIDDLE attack. 


ARP POISONING ACTORS 


	1. Two network nodes (clients, servers, routers, printers,..) 

	2. The attacker 

		
		+ Attacker can manipulate other hosts ARP cache tables by sending "gratuitous ARP replies" 

	+ Gratuitous ARP Replies = unsolicited ARP reply messages -> the attacker sends a reply without waiting for a host to perform a request 

	+ Attack exploits gratuitous ARP messages to tell the victims that they can reach a specific IP address at the attackers MAC address 

		- Tells machine A that they can find machine B at the attacker MAC address instead of B 

	+ Operation is performed on every victim 

	+ Attacker can prevent the poisoned entry from expiring by sending gratuitous ARP replies every 30 seconds or so


	+ Attackers machine receives packets, it must "forward them to the correct distination". Otherwise, the communication between the victim hosts will not work 


	+ Operation lets the hacker sniff traffic between the poisoned hosts even if the machines sit on a switched network 

	+ Attacker can also "change the content of the packets" thus manipulating the infomration exchanged by the two parties 



LOCAL TO REMOTE MITM 


	+ Attack can be used on ENTIRE NETWORK AND AGAINST A ROUTER, letting an attacker intercept the communication between a LAN and the Internet
	



DSNIFF ARPSPOOF 

	
	+ Dsniff = a collection of tools for network auditing and penetration testing.

		+ It includes "arpspoof" = a utility designed to intercept traffic on a switched LAN 
		+ Redirects packets from a target host (or all hosts) on the LAN intended for another host on the LAN by forging ARP replies"                               


	** + before running the tool, you have to enable the LINUX KERNEL IP FORWARDING, a feature that transforms a linux box into a router 


	+ By enabling IP forwarding, you tell your machine to forward the packets you intercept to the real destination host 

		# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward 

	Then run: 

		# arpspoof -i <interface> -t <target> -r <host> 

			+ INTERFACE = is the NIC you want to use, for example, "eth0" for you local LAN or "tap0" when you are connected to Hera Lab 

			+ Target and Host are the victims IP addresses 


	EXAMPLE: 

		+ To intercept traffic between 192.168.4.11 and 192.168.4.16
		
			# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
			# arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.4.11 -r 192.168.4.16

			-> Run WIRESHARK and intercept traffic
