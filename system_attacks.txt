MALWARE 

	- virus
	- trojan horse
	- rootkit
	- bootkit
		- rootkits that circumvent OS protection by executing during the bootstrap phase 
		- start before the OS 
	- backdoors
		
		- made by two components: server and backdoor client 
		- backdoor server runs on the victim machines listening on the network and accepting connections / client runs on attacker machine 
		- old school backdoors: NetBus & SubSeven
		- firewall blocks connection to internet from machines -> use Connect-back BackDoor(reverse backdoor)
		- instead of having the victim machine act as a server and listening to the client(attackers) command, it acts as a client and connects back to the pentesters machines / would listen on a well known port like 80
		- firewall cannot tell the difference between a user surfing the web and a backdoor connecting back to the attacker 

	- adware
	- spyware
	- greyware
		- false between adware and spyware 
	- dialer
		- software that tries to dial numbers on dial-up connections
	- key-loggers
		- same restrictions as backdoor when it comes to bypassing firewall
		- hardware keyloggers = small devices that can be installed on keyboards or computers 
			- log key strokes internal internal memory
			- two trips to victim machine -> install it and one to retrieve it 
		- rootkit keyloggers = stealthy and more visibile to the victim user than software keyloggers 
			- work at kernel level by hijacking the operating system APIs to record strokes 
			- key is pressed on a keyboard a particular function of the OS Kernel is called through a mechanism called an INTERRUPT
			- different key = the keyboard interrupt is called 
			- take control of this function -> rootkit knows which key has been pressed 

	- botnet 
	- ransomware 
	- data-stealing malware 
	- worm
