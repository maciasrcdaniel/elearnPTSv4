Ping Sweeping 
	- ICMP packets sent to check if the host is live 
	- fping command 
		- improved version of standard ping 
		- does ping sweeps 
		- install on kali by default 
			# fping -a -g IPRANGE 
		- Surpress unreachable hosts 
			# fping -a -g IPRANGE 2>/dev/null
	- nmap command 
		- store finding to a -iL list 
		# nmap -sV -sC -iL test.list -O findings.txt 
		- "p0f" tool also used for offline OS fingerprinting 

	- Port scan origin
		- TCP connect scan 
			- if connection is closed scanner receives RST packet 
			- if open and three-way handshake is complete then scanner abruptly sends and RST to close the connection 
			- Sys admins can see alot of connections to specific machines so TCP SYN scans were invented 	

	- TCP SYN Scan 
		- Stealthy
		- SYN scan the scanner does not perform the handshake
		- Just sends the SYN scan 
		- If the RST is quickly received marked port is closed 
		- If scanner receives ACK packet then the port is marked open and scanner sends RST packet 

	- Scan a list 
		- -iL hosttoscan.txt 
		- scans a list 

	- Specific ports to scan 
		- nmap -p 21,22,129 <target> or -p 100-1000 <target> 

	- Server does not respond to pings 
		- use the -Pn swtich 
		- skips pings scan and acts as alive 

Spotting a firewall 

	- bigger network = firewall 
	- pay attention to incomplete results 
	- if TCP succeeded on well-known service -sV version should not have any trouble identifying 
	- example of firewall
		#80/tcp open http? syn-ack ttl 64 
		- question mark on the http
		#80/tcp open tcpwrapped 
		- service type not recognized 
		- tcpwrapped means TCP handshake was completed but host CLOSED the connections 
	- --reason switch
		- show explanation of why port is marked open or closed 

Masscan

	- large networks and scan thousands of IP's at once 
	- faster than nmap, but less accurate
